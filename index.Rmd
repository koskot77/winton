## Introduction

Here I describe a project that spinned-off from a recent
[Winton's Machine Learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-winton-stock-market-challenge/data).
I am not concerned with outlining the solution or covering some other details of this rather difficult
competition. My main goal is to describe the new R package, that solves a problem of finding correlated
series on a massive scale. There are some other packages on the market such as `amap`, but I found
that these could not cope with size of this problem.

With my R package the resources sitting on my laps were just about sufficient for the exercise,
which is $\mathcal{8}$GB RAM of my $\mathcal{4}$-cores laptop processing $\mathcal{40}\mathrm{K}$ events.
Unfortunately, the quadratic running time and, more importantly for R, quadratic memory footprint
pose a conceptual limitaion of the scalability meaning that twice bigger input would render
useless any machine in my reach.

Nonetheless, this R package can be useful for any data analysis that requires finding and grouping 
together events comprising correlated series of measurements (e.g. time series) for a dataset of
up to $\mathcal{O(50\mathrm{K})}$ events.
